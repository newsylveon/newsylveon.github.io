[Chorus]
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...

[Verse 1]
Steal my phone —
You’ll find nothing there.
Track my home —
But no one lives there.
I shut it off
Before I sleep at night,
No psi-op waves,
No glowing lights —
The dopamine’s enough!!!

[Bridge]
What do I think?
And what do you see?
What do I think?
And what do you see?

[Chorus]
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...

[Bridge]
What do I think?
And what do you see?
What do I think?
And what do you see?

[Chorus]
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
There’s no more truth, no no no no no...
