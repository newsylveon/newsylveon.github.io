маты: yes

[Verse 1]
This is my childhood — maybe it’s yours too.
An inheritance lost, the author couldn't pull through.
Sold off to strangers so you'd clearly see
Even in this backup age, warmth slips away from me.

[Chorus]
I will draw on the wall my final little sign,
My last "hello to all" in a pixelated line.
Then I’ll wipe it away —
Let no one catch that display.

[Bridge]
Rest in peace, VK.
Worse by the day, but that’s always the way…

[Verse 2]
Pavel Durov built the Wall, then it fell to dust.
Some painted without pay, some grew flowers in trust.
Crushed beneath ads and a government scheme,
They took what can't be taken — or so it would seem.

[Chorus]
I will draw on the wall my final little sign,
My last "hello to all" in a pixelated line.
Then I’ll wipe it away —
Let no one catch that display.
