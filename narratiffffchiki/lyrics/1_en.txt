[Intro]
Welcome to tomorrow’s now...

[Verse 1]
Synthetic meat — guess I’ll be a cannibal.
Bioreactor, give me a face that's edible.
I’ll sink my teeth in, damn, it tastes divine —
We fight off hunger just to act unkind.

[Hook]
Welcome to tomorrow’s now...

[Verse 2]
While I suffer in public — make sure they see.
Let some AI shit solve my problems for me.
I just consume morality, same-day delivery.
Maybe I could do it all, but I’m feeling too lazy.

[Bridge]
Fall asleep...
Consume deep...
Fall asleep...
Consume, repeat!

[Hook]
Welcome to tomorrow’s now...
Welcome to tomorrow’s now...
