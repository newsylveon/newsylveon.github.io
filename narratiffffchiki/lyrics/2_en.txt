[Chorus]
I’m so scared of going places —
Cinemas, restaurants, all their faces...

[Verse 1]
Never played along with the show.
Easy to forget if you’re actor or pro.
Buy belief in some clean tomorrow —
The survivor learned no lessons, though...

[Chorus]
I’m so scared of going places —
Cinemas, restaurants, all their faces...
What else you got?
I’m so scared of going places —
No museums, no bars, no shops, no slots.

[Verse 2]
Let’s make it simple, drop the status.
No more posing, no theatrics.
Stop filling up the digital masses —
All the feeds, the channels, reactions.

[Bridge]
Why want so bad to stand apart? (It’s dangerous! It’s dangerous!)
It’s not to be — it’s playing the part.
Why want so bad to stand apart? (It’s dangerous! It’s dangerous!)
It’s not to be — it’s selling the art.
(You’re living ads now, a product from the start.)

[Chorus]
I’m so scared of going places —
Cinemas, restaurants, all their faces...
What else you got?
I’m so scared of going places —
No museums, no bars, no shops, no slots.
