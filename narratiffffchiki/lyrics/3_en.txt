[Verse 1]
I want something, but it all feels pointless.
Days stretch thin, the air grows joyless.
I’ve been numb to life for a while now —
Feels a lot like boredom somehow.

[Chorus]
Skipping the day — procrastination.
Tons of ideas, but I stall the creation.
Not even up yet, and I’m already drained.
Skipping the day — procrastination.
Tons of ideas, but I stall the creation.
Not even up yet, and I’m already drained.

[Verse 2]
Big ambitions, but the power ran out.
Didn’t even wake, already full of doubt.
I’m like air control — surrounded by flights,
All piloted by folks chasing neon lights.

[Chorus]
Skipping the day — procrastination.
Tons of ideas, but I stall the creation.
Not even up yet, and I’m already drained.
Skipping the day — procrastination.
Tons of ideas, but I stall the creation.
Not even up yet, and I’m already drained.
