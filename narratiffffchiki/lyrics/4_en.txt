[Verse 1]
Everything fades out of style.
That’s fine, lol — no denial.
We just forget for a while —
Maybe nostalgia will come reconcile.

[Bridge]
Seems like time's got a taste for design.

[Chorus]
Time moves on, and it spares no one.
In eternity, maybe just one
Thing remains — that carpet so worn,
With its dear maze-pattern that’s never gone.

[Verse 2]
Looks like I'm stuck in twenty-ten.
No aesthetics, just routines again.
I shut the door on each new trend —
Function feels safer than ads that pretend.

[Bridge]
Seems like time's got a taste for design.

[Chorus]
Time moves on, and it spares no one.
In eternity, maybe just one
Thing remains — that carpet so worn,
With its dear maze-pattern that’s never gone.
