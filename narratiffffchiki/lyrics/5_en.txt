[Intro]
Yeah, I need the one — the one that doesn’t exist.
Yeah, I need the one — if she shows up, she’ll cringe and dip.

[Verse 1: New Sylveon]
Feels like the whole world’s against me.
Mass extinction in daylight.
Unmarketable product — but why am I a product?
The best ones will die, the worst will multiply.
You're so surface-level — where’s my venom?
If everyone’s like this, there’s nothing to lose.
Genetic gambling — that's a trigger to shoot.
Need to leave the room — it’s too scary again.

[Chorus]
Yeah, I need the one — the one that doesn’t exist.
Yeah, I need the one — if she shows up, she’ll cringe and dip. (×2)

[Verse 2: дима фефилов]
The realest incel, no one asked me.
Didn’t even want this — I already took the blackpill.
I won’t betray you like that nasally dude.
"Man should be first" — that’s verbal sewage.
Feel like Elliot Rodger.
I made peace — nothing will help me.
I feel like shit, but at least I’m not dead.
It’s not my fault — it’s all the girls’ instead!

[Chorus repeats]
