guitar tune: Drop D
маты: нет матов

[Chorus]
You’ll get nothing!
That’s the weird deal we signed!

[Verse 1]
By clicking "continue" — you already accept.
All the terms and the traps, you agree to it all.
Not a product, a service — it’s all just fleeting.
You own nothing, but pay monthly fees.

Why save and buy when you could have it now?

[Chorus repeats]

[Verse 2]
Waiver of all complaints, surrender of data,
Your soul, your docs — now you’re nameless, beta!

(Chorus repeats again)
