[Intro]
We’ll call you back.
We’ll call you back.

[Verse 1: New Sylveon]
How much work does it take just to live okay?
Where do they pay enough — tell me what to play.
Don’t dream of real estate, no cars in my mind,
Just enough for the rent, and a little on the side.
They won’t take me in warehouses or stores,
Not with a diploma, not even forty years old.
No friends to recommend, no family plugs —
From paycheck to paycheck — lucky, but tough.

[Hook]
We’ll call you back — once we’ve checked the candidates.
We’ll call you back — once you’re rich and celebrated.
We’ll call you back — once it’s far too late.
We’ll call you back — don’t take it all that seriously.

[Verse 2: кот курит]
That metallic taste stuck in my mind,
Playing games with me.
I want dollars.
Light a cigar
On a rich lady’s chest.
Don’t even see her bikini,
Her tan stays on me through the night.
Daytime — jerking off on the white beach.
Fuck your job, and fuck your resume!
Rap doesn’t hit, paintings suck,
Routine poisons — I’m not about that.
Papers, boxes, that bitch boss —
While I’m young, I won’t fuck around
With all that crap.
Only two people online really value me.
So I get two tickets
To somewhere warmer.
(Kot.)
