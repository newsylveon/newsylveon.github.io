[Verse 1]
How will you spend your holidays?
What are you sick of seeing?
Don’t air out the trash — hide it from the cleaner.
Don’t trust your secrets — less chance of grieving.

[Chorus]
I want to surprise you, it’ll be a thrill.
Nothing brighter, nothing realer than this kill.
I wrote the plot, the motive is blurred.
And they won’t find you — I’ll leave no word.

(Whisper: Come with me.
I see this world sucks too.)

[Verse 2]
You didn’t vanish — just turned invisible.
Gone from the photos, lost from the visuals.
Your friends forgot, your parents coped.
All the theories sounded like jokes.

(Chorus repeats)
