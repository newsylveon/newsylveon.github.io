[New Sylveon - Жить (Казалось че-то понял)]

bpm: 164
key: E
guitar tune: Drop C#
маты: маты

[Chorus]
Thought I figured it out —
I didn’t get shit.
I choose to live, live, live, live,
Like a big middle finger to them!
Thought I figured it out —
I didn’t get shit.
I choose to live, live, live, live,
Like a big middle finger to them!

[Verse 1]
They wanted to make me a celeb,
Two blocks of fame — I would’ve fled.
But maybe I ghosted for the best.
Years later, they still need me, I guess.

[Chorus repeats]

[Verse 2]
Now I try at fifteen percent.
Just my Korg, my guitar — no experiments.
My image sucks, my music is open-source,
But I like it that way — it’s not serious, of course!

(Chorus repeats + Outro: Live, live, live — in spite of them!)
